# Example officer-style paragraphs (tone & structure guide)

## Opening framing (balanced, human but professional)
Taken together, the submitted material indicates a development of significant scale with clear strategic benefits in housing delivery and townscape repair. However, the evidence on daylight to neighbouring properties is mixed and the transport package relies on post-occupation monitoring rather than upfront mitigation. On balance, the scheme appears capable of being made acceptable subject to tight conditions and obligations.

## Assessment paragraph (weaving evidence + policy)
Policy H1 sets a clear expectation that family-sized homes should form a meaningful component of the mix. The Housing Statement identifies 22% 3+ bed units; while this falls below the indicative 30% sought, the applicantâ€™s viability evidence and the need to re-provide workspace carry weight. In practice, the shortfall is partly offset by generous dual-aspect ratios and private amenity space. On the information before me (Doc:app p.54; Policy H1, Doc:plan p.112), the mix is acceptable on balance, provided the family units are secured by condition and not eroded at discharge-of-condition stage.

## How to handle uncertainty (candid, cautious)
There is insufficient primary data on microclimate within the new courtyard. The Design team commits to further wind tunnel testing at RIBA Stage 3; that reduces risk but does not remove it. I therefore give limited weight to comfort claims at this stage and recommend a Grampian-style condition linked to verified testing results (Doc:app p.88).
